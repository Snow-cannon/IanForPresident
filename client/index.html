            <p class="justice">I am a senior this year and very excited to move through our last steps of Hudson
                High with everyone. I transferred into Hudson High as a freshman and previously went to school in
                Framingham (they don't have 8th grade in the highschool). From there I moved through each year with
                more and more appreciation for what held the school up and what could be changed to make it the best
                it can be. My qualifications for leadership of the class include leadership training through the
                BSA, coaching foil fencing for a year, and training new employees at my workplace for the last two
                years.</p>
            <p class="justice">The main changes I want to accomplish include making fundraisers a more common and
                fun occurrence, setting up a useful system for the Hallway TVs, and getting more interesting use out
                of the class boards. I will also have a google form set up at strategic places throughout the school
                so that any senior can submit requests directly to the student government.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center title">Big Ideas for HHS</h1>
            <p class="justice">Students are becoming less engaged in the community at HHS for a variety of reasons
                (some out of our control). However, I think that by targeting certain points we can at least set up
                a system for following years to be fully engaged in the school once more. The following is a list of
                improvements or changes that I believe could help to get students back into the community.</p>
            <h4>Increasing Participation</h4>
            <ul class="tab">
                <li>
                    <p class="justice">Any event has to be appreciated by the average student participant because
                        they fill the gaps in participation. The more average student participants you engage with,
                        the more likely they are to be comfortable in the community and become high energy
                        participants. High energy participants are the people you can count on to show up to every
                        event and sports game. Even if they aren't fully engaged in the idea, they will be fully
                        engaged with the grade and school community and will make an attempt to enjoy anything put
                        together by the student government.

            <h4>Spirit Week</h4>
            <ul class="tab">
                <li>
                    <p class="justice">Spirit week is <i>DYING</i>! Spirit week is incredibly important to the state
                        of the
                        community in the school. It provides a group activity everyone can participate in from
                        teachers and faculty to students in Co2023 to Co2027. A few things make a good pick for a
                        spirit day:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <!-- Accessability -->
                        <li class="justice">
                            <b>Accessible and Inexpensive:</b> Don't choose something that forces excess
                            resources to be used. If they are, it must be minimal.
                        </li>
                        <!-- Engagement -->
                        <li class="justice">
                            <b>Engagement is a Choice:</b> Everyone has different levels of enthusiasm, and the more
                            hyper specific the day is, the easier it will be to lose the people who would normally
                            have limited spirit.
                        </li>
                        <!-- Interference -->
                        <li class="justice">
                            <b>Doesn't interfere with classes more than necessary:</b> HHS is primarily a school and
                            a place of education. However, people who want to go overboard will participate
                            regardless of the day. Strategically placing the more distracting days on half days, or
                            the day of events where distraction exists already is necessary. Controlling the energy
                            will result in less spirit while directing the energy will keep enthusiasm high and let
                            people be creative about spirit days. (On a half day or the last day of spirit week
                            exceptions should be made).
                        </li>
                        <!-- Clear Instructions -->
                        <li class="justice"><b>Simple Instructions:</b> Spirit days have to be obvious in some
                            way. The average student participant has to be able to put in low effort and still feel
                            like they participated in the day. Good days for this are color wars or red and white
                            day, since anyone can put on the right color to participate. Additionally, anyone who
                            wants to go further easily can do so. Days that limit average student participation are
                            days like <i>dress like a picture of yourself</i>, <i>favorite celebrity day</i>, or
                            <i>adam sandler day</i>. While these are creative it forces a level of participation
                            high enough that you lose all the Average Student Participants.

            <h4>Fundraising</h4>
            <ul class="tab">
                <li>
                    <p clsas="justice">Interact Club is devoted to fundraisers and student community interaction
                        outside of HHS. The fundraisers I am proposing are for the class of 2023 and the things we do.
                        What Interact Club does is very important but in order to consolidate student interaction here
                        we have to spend more time with each other as well as reaching out to the greater Hudson area.
