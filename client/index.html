            <p class="justice">I am a senior this year and very excited to move through our last steps of Hudson
                High with everyone. I transferred into Hudson High as a freshman and previously went to school in
                Framingham (they don't have 8th grade in the highschool). From there I moved through each year with
                more and more appreciation for what held the school up and what could be changed to make it the best
                it can be. My qualifications for leadership of the class include leadership training through the
                BSA, coaching foil fencing for a year, and training new employees at my workplace for the last two
                years.</p>
            <p class="justice">The main changes I want to accomplish include making fundraisers a more common and
                fun occurrence, setting up a useful system for the Hallway TVs, and getting more interesting use out
                of the class boards. I will also have a google form set up at strategic places throughout the school
                so that any senior can submit requests directly to the student government.</p>

            <p class="justice">(Â¡HOLAðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜®MUCHACHOS!ðŸ¤©ðŸ”¥) My name is Olivia and I'm a senior. I've been going to HPS my
                whole
                life and have grown up with much of our grade. I still remember dumping water on myself during Farley
                Fun Day, dressing up for the Monster Mash in 6th grade, and getting car sick on the bus ride to the
                8th-grade boat cruise. Besides this, I've been in student government for a cumulative 6 years and am a
                part of several HHS clubs/groups including Interact Club, NHS, Math club, Ski club, Community Council,
                Board Games club, and after school chorus. Though senior year marks the end of an amazing era, the
                journey isn't over until June 3, 2023: graduation day. That's 9 months of potential for a final
                class-of-'23 push for greatness. (explosions)
