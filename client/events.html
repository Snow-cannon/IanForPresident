            <p class="justice">As the senior class it's partially up to us to set an example and leave a school that the
                future grades can be proud of. Interestingly, this requires the 2023 gov to spend more time focusing on
                improving the other grades separate communities. The easiest way to help the other grades and make grade
                pride soar is by holding events for everyone to go to. I suggest that any events planned that could
                involve the other grades (excluding the last and first) should.</p>
            <p class="justice">Pep rallies are honestly not a problem at this point. The most important thing is to keep
                inter-class comps going. Pep rallies should not run from the idea of an indoor venue when in the gym
                they are much more audible, and the gym is not so spacious as to make the sports teams feel smaller
                than they really are.</p>
            <p class="justice">The Red Sea is a great asset and should be used to the fullest we can. A representative
                from the Red Sea should come to government meetings as a further representation of the class since the more
                people elected that show up, the better the representation. They will be responsible for creating the
                spirit themes for games, promoting outreach for games, helping to corral the Red Sea for chants, and
                putting the best foot forward from HHS at other schools.</p>
