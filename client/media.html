            <p class="justice">There are many ways that students get information throughout the school year. Some are
                well made and consistently updated such as the HHS round robin and morning announcements. Others
                could be worked on to improve the way students can get to know whats going on.</p>
            <h4>Friday Morning Lights</h4>
            <ul class="tab">
                <li>
                    <p class="justice">Friday morning lights should show each and every sports team's successes, not
                        just wins, and display more than just the popular sports (this will help get more people back
                        into the sports programs that need people).</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>HTVSHall</h4>
            <ul class="tab">
                <li>
                    <p class="justice">The HTVSHall TV system is, in my opinion, poorly used. If we need to put a map of
                        the school on the wall it doesn't need a monitor. However, I do think the system can be very
                        useful and should still be run. The Friday morning lights are great and an incredible asset to
                        the school community, but it should not be used on repeat throughout the school for the
                        following week (especially with no audio). I suggest we make an enrichment that helps create the
                        HTVS slides which could be set on repeat throughout a day. Things to include are events, sports
                        updates, the schedule, and general announcements (which can be submitted by teachers for clubs).
                        The more we can put in the HTVS the better, and the less poster clutter will be around the
                        school. </p>

            </ul>
            <h4>Posters</h4>
            <ul class="tab">
                <li>
                    <p class="justice">Posters are useful, but we should make sure to consolidate the old posters and
                        take them down ASAP. If the posters in the halls are not up to date people will stop
                        reading them and they will serve a limited purpose.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Class Boards</h4>
            <ul class="tab">
                <li>
                    <p class="justice">Class boards are useless right now and the only purpose they server is to show
                        how empty the school feels its activity is. They should show event pictures, autograph boards
                        for events, and if any inter-grade comps are won they should get a banner or certificate for the
                        board. If nothing else the boards should show what each of the classes have been up to.</p>
