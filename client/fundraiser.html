            <p class="justice">The better we fundraise the easier it will be to improve events, graduation, and
                turnout! One easy way to improve fundraisers is to introduce raffles or more competitive fundraisers.
                Also plan for a fundraiser every other month as well as an event in the gaps because the more government
                based events that are held, the better. Even if the event doesn't use all the money from the previous
                fundraiser the next events can. Setting up patterns like this can make it easier to continue when
                problems arise.</p>
            <p class="justice">Many students have lots of unspent creative energy that could help improve the school
                and community. <i>LET'S USE IT</i>! ARC is a perfect opportunity to set up an enrichment to make
                posters, plan the Hall TV System (HTVS), make fundraiser items and more. The Interact Club is devoted
                to fundraisers and student community interaction outside of HHS. The fundraisers I am proposing are for
                the class of 2023 and the things we do. What Interact Club does is very important, but in order to
                consolidate student interaction here we have to spend more time with each other as well as reaching out
                to the greater Hudson area.</p>
